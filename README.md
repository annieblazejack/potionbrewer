This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```bash
# Vercel Blob Configuration
# Get this token from your Vercel dashboard:
# Go to your project settings > Storage > Blob > Environment Variables
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_read_write_token_here

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features

- **Potion Brewing**: Select ingredients and generate unique potion recipes using AI
- **Recipe Sharing**: Save and share recipes with other witches using Vercel Blob storage
- **Shared Recipe Loading**: Load shared recipes via URL query parameters (e.g., `?recipe=recipe-id`)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
